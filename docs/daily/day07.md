**Focus:** Weekly review

- [x] Weekly summary notes
- [ ] Any screenshots

## Day Log
- Date: 2026-02-19
- What I built:
  - Completed Week 1 summary document with build outcomes and evidence checklist.
  - Consolidated Days 1-6 into a single progress narrative.
- What I learned:
  - Consistent daily evidence turns ad-hoc lab work into resume-ready proof.
  - Weekly summaries expose gaps faster than daily notes alone.
  - Repeated VM bring-up/deallocate cycles need a standard operating checklist.
- Issues/risks:
  - Screenshot evidence still needs manual capture in Azure Portal and local terminal.
- Next steps:
  - Start Day 8 Terraform foundation with real `init/plan/apply`.
